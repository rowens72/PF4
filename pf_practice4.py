# Write a Python function called mult_list() to multiply all the numbers in a list.
#def  mult_list():

# Write a Python function called rev_string() to reverse a string.
#def rev_string(): 

# Write a Python function called num_within() to check whether a number falls in a given range.
# The function accepts the number, bseginning of range, and end of range (inclusive) as arguments.
# Examples: num_within(3,2,4) returns True, num_within(3,1,3) returns True, num_within(10,2,5) returns False.
#def num_within(): 

# Write a Python function called pascal() that prints out the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.
# The function accepts the number n, the number of rows to print
# Note : Pascal's triangle is an arithmetic and geometric figure first imagined by Blaise Pascal. 
# Each number is the two numbers above it added together.
#def pascal():



# call functions above
print(max_num(1, 6, 3))
